# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*

A small quote trivia game in which a quote is given and the use must answer with the quote's author/whom the quote is attributed to.
On a correct guess the game ends, but failure to get the correct author will result in the game iterating again until the
correct answer is given

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*

Authors whose names are not formatted as *firstname* *lastname* appear more obvious, as the fake names do not adjust to match

Unable to limit answers given to names listed (user an input any string).

If a name has characters not on a standard US keyboard, it is difficult to type.
## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*
